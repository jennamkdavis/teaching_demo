1,"Hi, guys, thanks for the meeting. Good to see you guys again. Just got a quick—I don’t know if it’s a question or basically a comment. I have a lot, but I don't want to take up everybody’s time. I think we can do that later, but I guess the concern that I have is now that I'm seeing a few more of these commercial corridors you're looking to build. The area desperately needs commercial, but you guys are working on an Arbor and East proposal, and there is an Edgemere Commons that's already been approved, which is going to have a lot of square footage of commercial.
 
So I'm just wondering, obviously, we see that, you know, commercial in the long run is going to get harder and harder for small businesses to stay open, not just due to COVID but changing consumer habits as far as shopping online and things like that. So, has that been really looked at and studied because Edgemere Commons is going to have a tremendous amount of commercial and Auburn East combined is going to have a tremendous amount of commercial? So I'm just wondering if that's been thought about and what your thoughts are on that?",40.59678646,-73.77784724
2,"Hello. Hi. I think this is very interesting. Since we spoke while you were on 40th Street, I think a couple of things. I assume you observed a huge traffic backlog that extended—you didn’t see it—but on Beach Channel Drive, it extended from somewhere past 40th Street back to 32nd Street. I’m wondering whether you've investigated the traffic impact and the effect of the DOT turning over the job of licensed professional engineers through city planners, number one. Number two, I was wondering to what extent you asked people what they thought of additional housing versus other uses? Because, while I was there, as you will recall, when I asked people what they thought of additional housing, the answer was uniformly against it, regardless of the interviewee's race or ethnic background. So, I’d like your response to that. And third, what would you suppose would be a response to a ballot initiative to close down HPD as an anti-social organization?",40.59763219,-73.7752483
3,"Have you had, when you stopped people on the street or people came up to you at 40th Street last weekend, was it? Um, what percentage of the people were in favor of more housing? Roughly? I know you didn't, you know, write it down. I will just comment one more thing in terms of resiliency. Once upon a time I lived on Beach 38th Street. 1949, people used motorboats and aside from canoes on the street, the water was so deep, but since then the city has raised it about five or eight feet so I don't recall it's ever flooded. And your discussion saying Edgemere was most affected during Sandy certainly the whole peninsula was, but I would suggest that the area that was most affected was Rockaway Park, which is an upper-income area not to minimize what anybody suffered during Sandy, which was awful.",40.59778254,-73.77475326
4,"Good evening everyone, it's great to see everyone again, summer's almost over, it's unbelievable, isn't it? So, um let me start by saying that I love the idea of the one and two family homes, the reasoning to do that. That is something we talked about from the day we began recovering from Sandy and the areas that there will be no development on because of the inability for anyone to mitigate the flood hazards in those areas along the bay. So those rezonings certainly is something we expected and and I support and the community land trust is very exciting and a great opportunity for many folks.
 
The selection of the not-for-profit is going to be critical in that although we want local, and I don't know who is eligible locally, it is in addition to local, I think a greater importance is someone that has prior experience in this area, that it not be someone new and unexperienced. So I think that's quite urgent. The concern I do have, I have to say is the request for rezoning from the R4 to the R6A, which is to the mid-rise buildings. It's going to bring in four buildings, 500 units, and I don't think those sites are large enough. I'm not going to bore everyone with the statistics I presented during Auburn East, but in the 1950s and 60s, the city built over 7,000 units of affordable housing on very expansive pieces of land that provided green space, playgrounds, parking, meeting areas for individuals. Dunes one and two are concrete buildings, there are no outdoor meeting spaces, they're built right to the sidewalk and it looks terrible and it's not a welcoming place that you feel you're at home. You, I go past it and think, oh my god how do these folks feel?
 
So I really, it is the upzoning to the 500 units in those mid-rise buildings that have not been thought out. It does not provide any of the things you would expect that people in the city of New York deserve. Regardless of their income level, they deserve to live in a positive, healthy environment and I don't believe those buildings do that. I do have one question, I think in one of the, uh, on one of the pages and and the page with all the pictures give a demonstration of what zones one and two looks like now and it's just concrete. It's concrete and nothing else. You, I think someone said that the commercial space in Dunes one and two is 3,000 square feet and if I'm right, can you tell us what commercial space is occupied and by what types of commercial enterprises?""

So, what I would like to see, please, each of those four sites, the R4, what would be the max filled out if it stayed as R4 and what type of housing, and then if it went to R6A, what would be the max filled out, including right to the sidewalk, no side yard, no anything, and how many units it could be? So you can certainly give that to us, but that is certainly something, if we're going to make an educated decision on our position, we would need to know that.",40.59938001,-73.77571858
5,"Can you hear me? Okay, so, um, my question is, is whoever is involved in this project, the city or whoever, are they going to hold the contractors responsible, like, um, the contractors that did the Build it Back and these contractors that did Build it Back... Okay, great that they lifted 109, um units up, but they spent or they were paid close to a million dollars for each unit, and the units were only worth a quarter of a million dollars. It would have been better if the people that owned the homes, they would have got the million dollars and they could have decided what they wanted to do.
 
Now, Dune 1 and Dune 2, it seems like Dune 3 is, is the same contract that did Dune 1 and Dune 2, and the back of the building they didn't, they didn't create a sidewalk, and it's like garbage is there, and mildew, and these and there should have been, um, retail space in dune one and two, because none of the lots that are in the beach 40s are designated for any retail.
 
And the doom 3 is slotted for retail when they have the little mall, uh, where the bravo uh thing is, and these contractors, they need to be ambassadors, not just build and, and they make a profit and they leave the, the what they do, shady work. So, who is anybody going to hold these contractors liable and for this L M contractor to do Dune 3? It should be contingent on them fixing the back of the building, where it should have sidewalk, it should have lighting, it should they should be ambassadors and put like signs, banners that, um, the people that walk from the nursing home when they go to the steps of the train say they like, we promote or we support our essential workers. They shouldn't have to be walking through the back way where there is no sidewalk. So, who's going to hold these contractors accountable when they're doing shady work?",40.59915449,-73.77653539
6,"Okay, hi, good evening, everyone. Um, so I wanted to first start off by, I mean, I know what a CLT is. I know, um, I basically know what a CLT is, but not everybody knows what a community land trust is, right? So, um, I believe you explain to it where, it’s led by, because I want you to tell me and everyone else, who actually runs the CLT, right? Who runs the community land trust? I believe you said it was non-profits, correct? And who picks those non-profits? Is it HPD that picks those non-profits? And what’s in it for the non-profits?",40.59733149,-73.77715419
7,"So I wanna, I want to touch a little bit on the resiliency, right? So, um, you know, I live in Edgemere, right, my whole thing is, you know, yes we need resiliency, right, flooding, we need control of that, you know, we need to fix that. In addition to, um, how access to the boardwalk, our access to the beach, right, our access to the boardwalk, we do not have, right? And this is stemming from, I’m on Beach 40th, so, we’re talking probably from Beach 36 all the way down to maybe 45th, 46th street, where there is no, I’m sorry it goes further, it goes further even down to down to 54th I believe. We can’t access the beach, right? So how, you know, for right now, currently, we can’t access the boardwalk, period, right? Because there's, is, is nothing there, it’s, you know, it’s, you take a chance just actually going to the boardwalk, walking the little makeshift path that’s there, you know, and in hopes that you don’t, uh, kill yourself or injure yourself or because it’s just not safe, right? So that entire part there needs to be, um, we definitely have to have access in addition to that, we can't access the beach as well, right, because of the piping clovers. So are you going to do something about that, about the piping plovers that, you know, that stems from, I mean for blocks that we can’t access the beach once that, once you do the ball walk? Alright, that’s fine, once you give us access to actually gain access to the boardwalk sufficiently, what’s going to happen when we actually want to access the beach, you know, with the piping plovers, like are you going to address that or, you know, is that going to be moved? Are you going to shorten the amount of space that's needed for the piping plovers so we can actually enjoy the beach in Edgemere?",40.59712475,-73.77651064
8,"Okay, so basically nothing's changing. The piping plovers will be there, and we cannot access that portion of the beach, which is pretty much from Beach 36... and correct me if I'm wrong, from Beach 36 to, um, Beach... I want to say 54th or 52nd, where there's like, that entire area is filled with the piping plovers?",40.59703078,-73.77190681
9,"So, you would enhance the access to the beach? Like, would there be pathways in between those particular streets, like between 38th and 57th, where we can walk through and still access the beach?",40.59607227,-73.77851554
10,"This is the last thing I'll say. As far as, you know, changing the R4 to an R6A... I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one that feels that we really don't need you to change that. We need more homeownership. With the Rain East project, it's going to be plenty of affordable apartments being built.
 
So increasing this... changing from an R4 to an R6A is just totally unnecessary. You're building more buildings, you're shifting people from one apartment complex to another apartment complex instead of actually having ownership. We need homeownership, right? In order for us to build generational wealth, that's one of the things that we need—homeownership. So, please, I would prefer you not to change that from R4 to R6A.
 
We also need access to healthcare and education, and we need jobs. You're bringing so many people here into the Rockaways, especially in this area, when there are no job opportunities. Like I said on our last call, can you make a commitment, if we can get something in writing, to say that, you know, they should actually hire from within? We have skilled professionals that live in Rockaway, we have plenty of them. So we need some sort of commitment. You're building all these different things, but what can you do for the people here who have been in Edgemere for years, who have put their blood, sweat, and tears into this community? We were promised so much at one point, and we have failed to see anything actually flourish here.
 
I bought my house here 15 years ago, and we were told that we were promised so many different things, and we've gotten nothing. So, we should actually get something sustainable, something that you can give back to us. It's a bunch of things I can go on about, but I'm not going to take up any more time. I appreciate it, thank you, and I'll let the next person speak.",40.59607227,-73.77690667
11,"Sure, absolutely. I appreciate it. So I’m looking through the old Edgemere Urban Renewal Plan, like I have the old Auburn Urban Renewal Plan. So one of the things that was discussed is now we're talking about this upzoning along what looks like it's along Beach Channel Drive. The whole Edgemere Urban Renewal Plan clearly states there was not to be more than 800 units. Okay, so with Beach Green Dunes 3 plus all of these 2-1 and 2-family homes, heights of the buildings were not supposed to be over 25 feet.
 
This is, I study this, this is not my plan, this is HPD's plan. This was a problem I have with HPD. I love that you guys want to do community improvement, but you sell the community one thing, and then when nobody’s paying attention—thank God I’m knowledgeable, and other people are knowledgeable—you go around and change what you’ve already proposed to the community.
 
This plan that was put out in 2008—and we know it’s a long time ago—but this is what was put out there, it’s been studied, environmental studies have been done, no more than 800 units, and the buildings were not supposed to be more than 25 feet.
 
So, what do you have to say about going and choosing what you want out of the study and then just doing whatever you want, going against your own rules and plan that you sold to the community and the studies for years? The people of Rockaway are kind of sick of it.
 
I don’t want to be confrontational; it gets me very agitated. I don’t want to get agitated, but you know, the Edgemere Urban Renewal Area was supposed to be no more than 800 dwelling units. A two-family home counts as two. The buildings were not supposed to be more than 25 feet. It clearly says it in HPD’s document, and I’ll send it to you if you need me to, and I’ll share it with the community so that you know it's a statement, but it’s a question: Why do you keep going against things that you’ve already sold us and we’ve already kind of determined? Yeah, I mean, you're going to greatly increase what was originally sold to us. I mean, someone like Sonia, she bought into the Edgemere Urban Renewal Area. That was part of the plan, and now you're going and changing it again. Because New York City has an affordable housing crisis, and the city is just going to look to bring everybody into Rockaway, so… okay, we’ll create 8,500 jobs, but you’re going to bring 25,000 people here with no— and listen, I love development, trust me, you know people that know me. But it’s got to be done right. If it’s not done right, you’re just creating persistent poverty. You’re just— you’re not providing people with opportunity. And I get it, you guys know a lot more than you did 20 years ago, 30 years ago, and I know your intentions are good. But also, your intentions are not only yours; they’re part of other people’s intentions as well. And we don’t trust the city, and we don’t trust developers. And we want to make sure that you’re sticking to the plan. It was supposed to be no more than 800 dwelling units, and buildings were not supposed to be over 25 feet in height as part of the urban renewal.",40.59742546,-73.77648589
12,"Can you hear me now? Hi, everybody. Man, um, I live in Auburn View, which is to be Ocean Village. And I kept telling everybody not to agree to becoming rent-stabilized, un-stabilized, and not everybody was educated in the process. And because everybody heard about the HPD Section 8 and all these wonderful things that were paved in gold, I kept telling them, no, it’s better if we just stay rent-stabilized. And now, we’re not rent-stabilized, and you have people who are working two and three jobs just to pay the rent. L&M still hasn’t fixed a lot of the issues from Sandy. We still have a lot of apartments that are vacant because they have mold, and in my apartment, I suffered with a lot of plumbing issues, a lot of leakage issues. And not only that, we’re understaffed, and the staff here are tired and exhausted, and they don’t want to speak up because they don’t want to lose their job. So, that’s nothing. L&M and Bluestone and Triangle— they should not get any more properties. Do not let them develop any more properties. And to everybody on this call tonight, I say that we need to organize and we need to take it to the media. That’s the only way that we’re going to get heard. It’s not the employees at HPD. They’re hired to do what they have to do to take care of themselves, but we have to do— we need to make sure we’re organized and that we take our message into the media. It’s not fair to be— my husband, I’m going to have to move to Delaware because we want good schools for our kids, and because we want to be homeowners. My husband should not leave the MTA where he’s basically wondering how he’s going to get from Jersey to the MTA and not be able to do all the time. These are things that we’re worried about because Rockaway does not have good schools. They let all these charter schools come in and take over the public schools. So that’s what we’re worried about right now: how are we going to give our kids a good education? And so, that’s what I say to the group right now. We need to organize and make sure that our voices are heard. Thank you.",40.59922966,-73.77660965
13,"Hi, thank you so much. This is really informative. My mother’s a real estate broker, and she is also really enjoying your presentation. If you can just let me know about some contact information that I can give her, that’s point number one. Please. Number two is educational opportunities, both in increasing school buildings, adding a school building on the site, you know, if there are accommodations for the existing residents that there are more schools for everybody who already lives in the area. And then, you know, take a survey if there’s going to be a huge population increase— there have to be more schools to accommodate all of the new potential students coming in. Especially going forward, if there is more social distancing and they have to add more classrooms so people can spread apart and still learn well, please take that into account. Then also, on the education standpoint, is there a curriculum that’s going to come in with regard to resiliency and environmentalism? And then the last question is— there’s a lot of trendy things happening with environmental education and environmental policies, green buildings, energy efficiency, solar panels, wind power, and then especially after the tropical storm a few weeks ago where a lot of the Rockaways lost power. If anybody needs help with that, they can call my office. But you know, what can we do to increase the environmental efficiency of these buildings that are going up, improve the existing utility infrastructure, and look into ways to prevent power outages from downed wires in the future? Thank you.",40.59451231,-73.77918384
14,"Hi, Desmond, hello. Yeah, so I actually have a question about the urban farms, and thank you for answering that question. I just had a follow-up. So how big are the allocation sites for projects like this?""",40.5945499,-73.77977788
15,"With the Build It Back program, is that coming back to Lake Homes? A lot of homes in the Far Rockaway area kind of missed out on that, uh, program, and I was just wondering if it's coming back. Um, that was one. My second question was the parking issue. Um, I'm like directly across from the audience projects, and most of those people do not pay the city for their parking, and they bombard my block, my block, and, uh, 40th Street and 41st Street with their, um, cars, and it's just really, really, really annoying. I could never get parking like in front of my house. I have to park, like, three blocks away or, you know, pull inside the yard, but I was just wondering what is going to work for that as far as parking is concerned and lifting homes.",40.59428678,-73.77846604
16,"One of the speakers spoke about the schools, and I understand that you have, um, some names that are aside for that, but the school should be built simultaneously with everything else. We're not going to wait for our families to move in and then decide, well, now we have to go to schools, because the families are going to have to send their children somewhere, which means that the other schools nearby are going to be overcrowded, and we do not want that. Who would want to move to a community where they do not know where they're gonna have, uh, where they're gonna take their children to school? So I really think that that is a must, as you're doing the development, that the schools are being built simultaneously so that when families come in, they have somewhere to send these kids.",40.59522652,-73.77794625
17,"Thank you. Okay, so I want to piggyback off of what Keon said, which is very true. For us homeowners here in Edgemere, parking has been a hassle—it’s been hell, if I can say that. You also have to take into account that we have the COVID-19 testing site here. Remember, that lot was supposed to be slated for a school, and which the other young lady has said previously—Marie's right, thank you, Marie—she said that the school should be built at the same time all these resiliency and other projects are going on, because we can't wait. Right? Because we see what happened when we waited. Right now, we have a COVID-19 testing site in our backyards that should not be there. So parking has become even more restricted, right? My idea is, and Eddie, I posted this in the chat so you don’t have to actually look at that. My question is, for us homeowners who literally bought into this Edgemere resiliency project when we bought our homes and were promised so many different things, is there a way to situate our parking where it’s only for the residents who were part of the initial Edgemere plan? I think that would be a great giveback to us, because we should not have to fight for parking. We should not have to clean up our streets. I don’t mind cleaning up our streets, because on several of our blocks, we don’t have oils in our street parking, and we’re responsible for cleaning up our own streets. I don’t mind that, but what I do mind is people coming to dump their garbage after we’ve already cleaned up. If there was restricted parking for the residents or homeowners within this community, that would definitely eliminate that. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve called about unsanitary practices, seeing people just come, dump their garbage, and then go across the street either to NYCHA or catch the train. I think restricted parking for homeowners within this community would be a great giveback to the people who bought into the Edgemere plan years ago when they started building homes here.",40.59703078,-73.77720369
18,"Good afternoon, I am David. As noted on the slide the city's environmental a framework for analysis meaning the conditions if the proposed actions are not to the with actual condition or the conditions if the proposed actions are. The methods preparation of the draft will be to analyze. The RWCDS reflects multiple family developments, two projected commercial sites pursuant to existing zoning in the future absent the proposed actions. I'll start with the no action condition which is the future condition without the proposed actions. If the proposed actions are not approved it is conservatively assumed that existing conditions throughout the area will remain unchanged. While the residential infill sites could be redeveloped on an as-of-right basis for conservative analysis purposes, the EIS is not taking credit for any development whatsoever on these sites under no action conditions. This worst-case building program would be built out over a period of 10 years and across 41 projected development sites. These numbers do not reflect a specific development proposal for the projected development sites, but have been developed for the purpose of assessing the potential for impact during environmental reviews. It is possible that some of the commercial based on this framework and as detailed in the EAS technical screenings, the draft scope identifies several technical areas for further analysis. The EIS will study 17 of the 19 facilities and services and cultural resources, transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change. The EIS will also include a detailed discussion of mitigation alternatives.",40.59704958,-73.77311964
19,"Hi, can you hear me? Yes, hi, good afternoon. Thank you for the presentation today. I have a couple of questions. Going back to the zoning part, I was a little confused where you said you would prohibit facility use with overnight sleeping. Can you just clarify what you mean by that? So, well as far as testimony, going over what was presented in reference to the zoning changes and the affordable units, I just wanted to state that when you say affordable units, I don't want it just to be a bunch of apartment buildings because we have that already in our Auburn East project. I would recommend that they will be actual homes to purchase for people, for most of the units to go to those who live in the community. And you also mentioned that the new EIS would, I saw that you included the water and sewer, that's fine, you know, because Rockaway does flood like a lot. But in Edgemere, we have a huge issue when it comes to flooding and our sewers. They continue to say that they repaired them and everything is working, and it has not worked for years. So, you know, a strong focus needs to be put on flooding within the Edgemere community. And you said you would increase the parking, so that's great. And also just basically flooding, resiliency, and also opportunities as well for those that live in the neighborhood in the areas of the Rockaway including Edgemere. We have a lot of people who have businesses of their own who would like to embellish on those businesses, so hopefully you can provide that opportunity for them as well within this project. Thank you.",40.59470026,-73.77695618
20,"Thank you for this opportunity. When we do the with and without actions, why is not the urban renewal plan that exists part of those without actions? Wouldn't that plan, this would, that plan would continue on along now since that plan was implemented? HPD has been accumulating all of those other vacant lots. So they are part of HPD's portfolio.?That portfolio in the alternative method could be placed at city auction. Why isn't that part of the without changes? Because without changes, the city owns the property, the city should be selling the property. Without changes, it's an Auburn East area allowing for the completion of 800 affordable homes for the community home ownership versus what we're speaking about now, which is 1,500 units, mostly affordable. Two different types of plans, and they should be compared to. The scope is only dealing with the confined area of 34th to 49th Street from the trestle to the bay. It's not including the impact that the peninsula site with affordable housing going in there, the Far Rockaway downtown site with affordable housing going there, the Edgemere urban renewals—excuse me, the Auburn East site with affordable housing going there. That effect on that amount of affordable housing in this one area of our community with what we have there as far as our community facilities, one hospital, the schools, all have to be studied.",40.59646695,-73.77809476
21,"Hello, can you hear me? I’m a member of the board of Bayswater Civic Association. I was requested to be part of the resilient Edgemere meetings that were held. I would note that the current resilient Edgemere project is posted on your website and is significantly different than the original resilient Edgemere report. Furthermore, nothing in the report addresses flooding. The idea that planting grass will affect high tide is absurd. There was and continues to be community opposition that there be no new housing in the area except one- and two-family detached homes, R1 and R2. No R4, no R6. The area roads are currently grossly inadequate for rush hour and summer traffic. The Peninsula Hospital EIS said that there will be significant traffic impact from the Nassau County line to Beach 116th Street when that project alone is completed, never mind Auburn East and downtown Far Rockaway. We believe, and we the Bayswater Civic Association all believe, east-west roads must have four traffic lanes plus parking, plus any bus lanes. All housing must be owner-occupied. We believe that the urban renewal plan should be canceled and withdrawn. HPD actions must comply with the U.S. Fair Housing Act. We believe the current plans are deliberately designed to accentuate segregation in the area. When you talk about underutilized, you're assuming that building a hundred-floor building would be appropriate. We do not believe that. The only construction really in the area should be parking for the existing residents. People who live in the housing projects, the NYCHA projects, now have to often walk close to a mile to park their cars, and you're just going to accentuate this problem. So I suggest that you withdraw your plans, that HPD closes up shop and goes out of business. Thank you.",40.59486942,-73.77782249
22,"Hi, good afternoon. This is Sonia Weber Bay. I've been a homeowner in Far Rockaway for over 40 years. I am a member of the Beach 43rd Street Block Association. I have three points that I'd like to make about the proposal. The first point is about the 1,201 units that are proposed. I think this is oversaturating the neighborhood. If you estimate 2.2 children in each of those units, there'll be over 2,000 children, and I don't hear any plan for a school or how that's going to impact the schools in the neighborhood. PS 106 is over 100 years old, has less than 250 students. PS 105 is close to capacity, being a K-8 school. I would like you to consider, with Auburn East and more children, how those children will be educated.
My second point is about recreation. Bringing that many additional families into the neighborhood, where in the plan is places for children to play? In these narrow lots where a house will be built, there's hardly any backyard or front yard. We need to consider places for children to play. My third point is a question really about the land trust that was mentioned early on in the presentations. If that is still part of the plan for a resilient Edgemere, I do not support that. I feel that families should have an opportunity for full ownership of their homes, including the land on which those homes will be built. Lastly, I think that there should be some consideration for the feel of our Edgemere neighborhood. As a previous speaker mentioned, we value the fact that we are a less dense neighborhood, a waterfront area, and our families, and our children, and community would like to stay that way. Thank you.",40.59812084,-73.77638688
23,"Good afternoon, hello everyone. I’m Anna Palmer. I call from Seagate Avenue and Friends Block Association, a community activist, and I live right around the corner from the project that is Auburn East. I've been speaking to some of the residents in the area, and they have concerns as well with the possible overcrowding. It isn’t so much the people as the resources in the area that’s lacking, because once the buildings are completed on my avenue, those stores and those areas will be inundated with people. So if you're going to build more housing in this area, we need the stores to support it as well. Transportation cannot support that many more people. The air quality may be affected. More trees need to be planted in the area to balance off the traffic that will be coming through. It can be a good project, especially the wildlife preserve, if we get the children involved and make it part of the curriculum of the school. And then we're also concerned—is that going to drive the price of the rent in this area? Once that is built up, are we going to be priced out and not be able to afford to live in this area?",40.59917328,-73.77636213
